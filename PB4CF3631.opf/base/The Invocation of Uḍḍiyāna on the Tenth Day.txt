The Invocation of Uḍḍiyāna[1] on the Tenth Day

revealed by Ratna Lingpa

I, the Lotus-Born, made these prayers,Filled with goodness for the benefit of all:Tertöns will
emerge in the times to come,Each to enjoy treasures deep and profound.

A great tertön there shall be for every great land,And a minor tertön for every little one.In
brief, the ways I tame are beyond imagination,For Uḍḍiyāna’s kindness is not slight, but
vast!

Every realm shall have a most sacred place,That will be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna;At every frontier
there will be a treasure trove,Likewise a monument to Uḍḍiyāna;

Every ordained monk each with a lineageShall be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna.In every land and every
city a mantrin –They too will be monuments to Uḍḍiyāna.

All practices for binding demons under oath –These are monuments to Uḍḍiyāna.All methods for
subjugating all eight kinds of demonsWill also be monuments to Uḍḍiyāna.

Every way to avert black magic and spellsWill be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna.And every tenth day
of every month –This too will be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna.

In sum, all the infinite ways to tame beingsShall be my monuments—monuments to Uḍḍiyāna.When
people yearn for me in times to come,Behold, I will be there, standing by their side.

When the tenth day of the month comes,Those who uphold these monuments of mineShall be inseparable
from me.

Every community with faith in the Dharma,I will care for you.Every town and every householdThat
acts out of virtue with faith in the Dharma,I will care for you.Amidst the pleasures and
painsof eating and drinking, going to and fro,Remember me but for an instant,And at that
very moment I will bless you—of that, be sure.Whoever yearns for me out of trust,Know that
we have been connectedFor eons upon eons beyond beginning.In time you will be born again
in my realm.The Lotus-Born does not speak false words.

So fill your minds with joy, those with faith,My followers in generations to come,And practice
the tenth day offering as follows:Place a large bali mixed with spices,Encircled by eight
colorful lotus petals,Upon a fine maṇḍala platform.Garnish the bali all around with garlic
and onions, meat and butter,And encircle the whole with precious objects,With butter lamps,
ritual cakes, water offerings and incense.It is also highly auspicious to perform a
fire offeringOf three whites, three sweets, an abundance of jewels,Of foods, drinks and various
powders—All that is in harmony with the maṇḍala you practice.Chant the Seven-Line Prayer
in your clearest voiceTo the sound of drum and conch and cymbal.As directed in the eighth
chapter of the activity manual,“Generally, proceed according to one’s own tradition.”[2]With
substances like meat, rice, garlic and onion,Go beyond all concepts of pure and impure,And
practice a bountiful gaṇacakra!

With body, perform ritual dances and assume the postures,And the experience of bliss shall blaze
forth.With voice, sing dharma songs and contemplative tunes,And your secret speech will
grow in power.With mind, cultivate samādhi without concepts,And the experience of realization
beyond words will dawn.Pray until you are stirred to tears,And let a flowing river
of blessingsWash over you, and through you.When these experiences are all ablaze,The blessings
have arrived,A sign that I am there in person.Have no doubt that I have truly come.

After I have travelled to the land of rakṣasas,On the tenth day of every month I will return.For
my children, my disciples, the mantrins of Tibet,I will come back personally—this is
a promise.The Lotus-Born does not deceive other beings,So be rid of your doubts, my followers.Make
your minds suitable, and every tenth dayDo as follows, child: make effort and pray,Certain
in your wish to cast off saṃsāra.Entrust me with your mind, your heart, your very
core!

People of later generations who trust in me,Disciples connected by their aspirations,Should
clear away any doubts, and be firm in their beliefAccording to these instructions so clearly
written.In truth, for me there is no traveling and no remaining.Although I am beyond both
coming and going,Even so, conventionally speaking,Within the dualistic experience of habitual
thought,I reside in the celestial realms.Yet due to these habits swirling about the
body’s enclosure,And due to the two veils remaining unpurified,None of you now can see my
face.But when the veils of your afflictions are totally cleansed,You will look upon me, Padma,
in person,And then there will be the chance to converse.Once you are a yogin well on
the path,We will meet in your meditative experiences and dreams.In reality, though, whoever
lets virtue arise in their mind,Or whenever immeasurable compassion wells up,Or when, for
a split second, you remember me,That too will be our meeting.For those who have a mind
filled with faith,My stream of compassion flows unceasingly.Ultimately, though I am beyond
going or coming.When your karma and veils are both washed clean,That is the moment when we
meet.According to the aspirations and relative perceptionsOf those beings capable of training,I
am indeed residing in the land of rakṣasas.And yet, because the stream of my compassion
is unbroken,There I am, beside all those with faith in me.

Now, I shall not explain much more,Because words are but a rotten corpse.In the end, just lay
the weight of your heart and mind on me.Whether your rank is high or low,Harbor no doubts:
my blessings will comeIn step with your devotion.On what should you rely for reaching accomplishment?The
invocation of Uḍḍiyāna on the tenth day!In short, those with diligence,
faith, and intelligence,Will be embraced by my compassion, just as I have said.May those with
the karma practice just so!

Emaho![3]Child of noble family, enjoy this profound treasure!In the final fifty years of the
degenerate age,When demon murderers are on the rampage,With swords unyielding,Laying waste
the holy places, plundering the sites—Such are the times when this instruction will be revealed.Iron
element in opposition, conduct unattached—Such are the signs of your noble birth.You
will be adorned in the crook of your right thighBy a mole both white and black.Below
your navel will be a mark, like the eye of a ḍākinī.Your shoulder will bear a mole, marked
like the eye of a ḍākinī.To the right of the hair that grows between his eyebrowsWill
be a mark, a mole like a fish’s eye.Your right flank will be marked by signs of the five ḍākinīs.May
all those with the karma meet you!

To the northeast of his treasure trove will be a marketplaceWhere people from north and south
gather together.There, three authentic women,Excellent in character, aged from thirteen
to forty-five,Will rely upon this yogin’s skillful means.And after they rely upon you,These
ones with excellent character, they who have so relied,Will take hold of ultimate awareness—have
no doubt of that!

If a shrine to the three kāyas is built at that marketplace,The southern border will be an area
especially auspicious and blessed.Of that, harbor no doubt at all, my followers.And if
you leave a yellow scroll at that placeThe consecration will be truly auspicious.

Samaya. Gya gya gya. Katham.
