↑ In the fifth chapter entitled The Chronicle of the Ministers of the terma treasure The Five
Chronicles, Kathang Denga, revealed by Orgyen Lingpa, it is stated: If you summarize the
life, liberation and awakening of the Guru Padmākara of Uḍḍiyāna, it can be subsumed into
the eleven deeds of the son of the conquerors. These are: 1. forming the enlightened intention
to tame beings, 2. descending into the lotus flower, 3. spontaneously taking birth,
4. enjoying the pleasures of a prince, 5. taking ordination, 6. practicing various austerities,
7. overcoming Māra's hosts, 8. attaining complete awakening, 9. turning the wheel of
the Dharma, 10. engaging in yogic disciplines, and 11. hiding terma treasures so that the
Dharma will spread far and wide and never wane. (Tib. u rgyan gu ru pad+ma ‘byung gnas te

took as his wife. She is frequently also called Prabhāvatī (‘od ‘chang ma).↑ Guru Rinpoche

(Tib. sprul pa’i sku), 2. Saṃbhogakāya (Tib. longs spyod rdzogs pa’i sku), 3. Dharmakāya
(Tib. chos kyi sku), and 4. Svābhāvikakāya (Tib. ngo bo nyid kyi sku).↑ Mandāravā↑
The bodhisattva Vajradharma who compiled the tantras and entrusted them for safekeeping
to the chief ḍākinī Karmendrāṇī.↑ The caves of Chimphu represent Guru Rinpoche’s enlightened
speech. Guru Rinpoche resided in the Chimphu caves, while Samyé monastery was being constructed,
and spent long periods there in retreat. The caves are located at the head of the
valley running parallel and to the northeast of the Samyé Valley, about 13 km from Samyé.↑
This refers to the Eight Vidyādharas of Tibet (Tib. bod kyi rig 'dzin brgyad): 1. King
Trisong Detsen, 2. Namkhé Nyingpo, 3. Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé, 4. Gyalwa Chokyang, 5. Yeshe Tsogyal,
6. Palgyi Yeshé, 7. Langchen Palgyi Sengé, and 8. Vairocana.↑ Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo
states, in A Beautiful and Wondrous Udumbara Garland (Tib. ngo mtshar u dum wa ra’i phreng
mdzes) verse 87: “At the age of fifty-nine, the king passed away, A fact that you kept
secret for fourteen years. Ruling the kingdom, you ensured in due succession The enthronements
of the Princes Muné and Mutik Tsenpo. And in each case you empowered the newly appointed
kings: homage to you!”↑ Tib. thod phreng rtsal. Eng. ‘Mighty Skull-Garland.’ One of
the names of Guru Rinpoche.
